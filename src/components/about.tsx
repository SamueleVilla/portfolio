        After I finished the secondary school, I enrolled in a coding bootcamp
        and meanwhile I begun an university course in computer science in Milano. I have
        pursued my passion for coding and IT world since I was a child. My favorite part of programming are
        the problem-solving challenges because I enjoy the feeling of figuring out the final
        solution. My core stack is based mostly on back-end technologies
        as Java and Node but recently, I have been interested in full-stack development with
        Next.js framework as well. I am also familiar with
        Typescript, Relational DBMS and Docker. However, I can provide IT consultancy for
        small projects and tutoring in computer science and mathematics.

        When I am not coding, I enjoy playing video games, watching movies
        training at the gym, and traveling. I enjoy even documenting on different
        things as well. I am currently learning about History and Politics.
