      <p className="mb-3">
        After I finished the secondary school, I enrolled in a coding bootcamp
        and meanwhile begun a university course in computer science in Milano. I
        always pursued my coding passion. My favorite part of programming is the
        problem-solving challenges. I really enjoy the feeling of the final
        solution of the challenge. My core stack is mostly backend technologies
        as Java and Node but recently I started some front-end projects with
        React (Next.js) which I liked to learn. I am also familiar with
        Typescript and Relational DBMS. I am always looking for different kind
        of projects and technologies. Currently I can provide IT consultancy for
        small projects and tutoring in computer science and mathematics.

        When I am not coding, I enjoy playing video games, watching movies,
        training at the gym, and traveling. I enjoy even documenting on new
        things as well. I am currently learning about History and Politics.
